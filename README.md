Instructions:


Best workflow practice should be to let GIFLight compress your video/GIF without any input for the “Desired GIF Size” box. This will output a GIF at maximum quality using its optimization engine.

Then you can input a Desired GIF Size and let it iterate through to reach your goal.
While you can certainly jump straight to this step if you want, it’s very processor intensive, and many times the baseline optimization from GIFLight is enough.




It’s processor intensive because this app prioritizes quality first, and with each pass will attempt higher diffusion amounts, lower frame rates, and other optimization tricks in parallel searching for the right combination to reach your goal size. On larger GIFs/videos, this process can take some time.






There are three options within the Options menu:


Lock Quality at Maximum: This will disable the app from adjusting the Quality setting during its conversion iterations. This will result in larger file sizes, but maximizes quality.


Disable Diffusion: This will disable the app from adjusting the Diffusion setting during its conversion iterations. Use this to completely eliminate the subtle visual noise from your GIF.


Do not lower frame rate: Locks the framerate to whatever the video/gif input framerate originally was.
